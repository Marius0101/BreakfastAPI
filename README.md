This project is use to learn more about building an API.
# Idea
The idee come from a [tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmDJIooZjBE) that I followed to learn more about building an API.

The first commit represent all what was taught on that video, anything else represent my curiosity to try to implement certain concepts.
